# GitHub repository for EquiTea at JBCA, University of Manchester. 

EquiTea is our monthly forum within JBCA/Physics & Astronomy to discuss EDI topics related to physics and astronomy. The EquiTea meetings are open to everyone, students and staff, regardless of background. The aim of these meetings is to encourage an informal space where people feel comfortable to ask questions and learn new perspectives.
